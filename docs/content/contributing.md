## ðŸ¥ˆ Report an error
Please open a new issue in the `timex_lca` [repository](https://github.com/TimoDiepers/timex/issues), describing the error and where you found it. 
A member of the timex_lca developer community will then take care of the issue, but it may take some time for your issue to be resolved.

## ðŸ¥‡  Fix an error yourself
If you have a solution to the error, you can create a fork of the `timex_lca` repository, make your changes and create a pull request. The developers will assess the changes and be eternally grateful!
Here is a description of the [GitHub contribution workflow (fork, branch, PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).
